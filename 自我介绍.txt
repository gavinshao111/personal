advantage/shortcoming
	I am very patient and considerate.
	before i work on project, i will put myself in that position, and preview the flow step by step.
	so i can find more problems and know whether i can figure it out before the start of a project.
	
	sometimes i would be stubborn.I would insist on my own opinion until someone prove my opinion was wrong.
